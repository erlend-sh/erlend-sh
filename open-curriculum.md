# Open Source Curriculum

This document aspires to become a comprehensive reading list for anyone seeking to deeply understand ‘open source’ as an ideology, a movement, an industry and more.

This curriculum teaches:

- What “open source” means
- How open source is used
- Economic & personal sustainability
- Software ethics

Whether you’re a newcomer to open source or you’ve been involved with the practice for some time, this curriculum aims to provide a comprehensive overview of everything open source is, and aspires to be.

In the open source spirit, this curriculum is itself open source, I.e. liberally licensed. I will diligently review the change requests that are sent my way, with the intent of having multiple co-editors before long. If someone strongly disagrees with how I exercise my final-edit powers, they’re free to *fork* my curriculum. If you don’t yet know what that means, you’ll learn very soon!

# What is open source

If you're absolutely new to the very concept of open source, start by watching these two introductory videos.

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tyd0FO0tko8&feature=youtu.be](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tyd0FO0tko8&feature=youtu.be)

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8fHgx9mE5U](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8fHgx9mE5U)

(Are you aware of a text writeup that explains open source in similar fashion to the videos above? We need one of those!)

Open source isn't limited to just software. Any *thing* with a blueprint that enables said thing to be inspected, duplicated or modified can (and probably should) be regarded as open source. This blueprint could be anything from the complete specification of an airplane, all the way down to the genetic code of a seed. The open *movement* therefore extends far beyond the confines of software.

Creative Commons is also a very plain-English way of understanding the open source ethos in plainer language.

For now this curriculum will focus on software because...

1. Open source software is arguably the furthest ahead of any openness movement.
2. The author(s) of this curriculum are chiefly familiar with software.

# Ideology

### Central authorities for the term “open source”

There is no single authority that ratifies what can be deemed open source or not. There are however a few organisations that are widely regarded as highly trusted.

## Why make anything open source

At first glance, open source sharing might just seem like charitable giving. A philanthropic endeavor to make the world we inhabit more open to scrutiny and modification. Yet while a sense of charity is certainly felt by many open source contributors, the practical benefits of open source licensing also align perfectly well with [egoistic altruism](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rvskMHn0sqQ&vl=en) as well as common-sense business strategy.

Economic incentives aside, the open source development methodology is simply an easier way to develop software. Openly accessible knowledge breeds more and better knowledge.

Open source ethics

Is open source biased towards being for “good”?

I think that’s a tough sell. NameOfGuy makes the case that open source has mainly enriched the the already-rich.

[Publication strategy](https://www.notion.so/Publication-strategy-4b25044eb39448cb9d001b9680e50357)

Roadmap

### v0.1

Mostly articles, with bits of writing in between. But the reading material alone will be quite comprehensive and neatly curated.

### Future

- Better guiding text in between articles.
- Brief summary of each piece.
- Fast track and a scenic route.

Open source is inherently about human experiences and psychology. The movement has many ties to intrinsic motivation, coping strategies, social anxiety etc.
