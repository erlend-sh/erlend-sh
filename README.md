### Work Brief
I've been working in open source, games and web tech for the past ~20 years. My most notable projects lasted for 5+ years:
- [jMonkeyEngine](https://jmonkeyengine.org/) – Project Lead. We made a fully functional game engine together, still in use by professionals and hobbyists today.
- [Discourse](https://www.discourse.org/) – first as a Community Advocate, then VP of Community and lastly a 6 month stint as a Product Lead.
- [Amethyst organisation](https://github.com/amethyst/) – Project Manager. Founding member of the [Rust GameDev Working Group](https://www.rust-lang.org/governance/wgs/gamedev).

### Personal Brief

I practice openness to the greatest extent possible, in my professional as well as my personal life. I described some of what that looks like in the open source booklet called [Open Source Explained](https://blog.erlend.sh/open-source-explained). Most of the source material for that work is listed in my [Open Source Curriculum](https://github.com/erlend-sh/opensource-curriculum).

These are some of the key influencers of my thinking as a digital activist and my practice of loving-compassion:
- [Douglass Rushkoff](https://rushkoff.com/) – Media theory
- [Krista Tippet](https://onbeing.org/our-story/krista-tippett/) – Poetic existentialism
- [Cory Doctorow](https://pluralistic.net/) – Digital reform
- [Erin Kissane](https://erinkissane.com/) – Digital research
- [Sam Harris](https://www.samharris.org/) – Mindfulness
- [Nate Hagens](https://www.natehagens.com/) – Systems thinking
- [Tara Brach](https://www.tarabrach.com/) – Embodiment
