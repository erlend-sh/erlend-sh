## Warcraft 3 Mods

As a teenager in the early 2000s I got my start in the online, openly collaborative tech world through the [modding community of Warcraft 3](https://www.pcgamesn.com/warcraft-iii/warcraft-3-mods-dota-league-of-legends) (not to be confused with *World of Warcraft* which I sadly/luckily never got into).

Doing design work, quality assurance and community management I helped a lead coder develop an RPG mod called [Isles at War](https://www.epicwar.com/maps/32342/). 

We had so much fun working together that we ended up attempting-and-failing to make a series of stand-alone games made from scratch, eventually leading us to work on general game tech instead of the games themselves.

## jMonkeyEngine

That *tech* was [jMonkeyEngine](https://jmonkeyengine.org/), a game engine in Java that is still humming along today! Most of what I know about open source I learned from ~7 years of working on that project. jME competed for my attention throughout several big milestones in my life:

- 6 months in Chile as an exchange student.
- 4 months in Ghana as a volunteer worker.
- 1-2 years of studying psychology and later Norse mythology at the University of Oslo.
- 2 years of studying Game Design at the Vancouver Film School in Canada.
- 6 months living in Vancouver, barely getting by as a WordPress contractor.
- 1 year working my first job at WeWantToKnow / DragonBox

## Vancouver Film School (Game Design)

Around 2011-2012 I enrolled in the 1-year intensive Game Design course of the [Vancouver Film School](https://vfs.edu/). Going abroad was my only option, since game development was not yet recognized as a professional discipline in my homecountry of Norway.

VFS was a magical place where our teachers were also seasoned game developers with recognizable titles to their names. Though as good as it was, its critical flaw was thinking that the best way to prepare us for an intrinsically broken game industry was to imitate that unsustainable culture by encouraging a work/life balance that left many of us burnt out and traumatized by the artform we loved.

> Ten years later I started my own, exceedingly informal [Open Gamedev School](https://spicylobster.itch.io/jumpy/devlog/345530/open-gamedev-school) as a bare-bones model of what I believe this type of education institution should be like.

## DragonBox

Working on the [DragonBox game](https://dragonbox.com/) was a lot of fun. Aside from daily support & website management, I also got to run a [nationwide game contest](https://dragonbox.com/about/algebra-challenge) in Norway with 36â€™000 participants.

But the most enriching experience I had with this company was the weeks spent going around to schools to play-test our games. Arriving with a dozen tablets, weâ€™d just let the kids (ages 6-10) play while we hovered over them with our notebooks. I had a whole new appreciation for the classic book [Donâ€™t Make Me Think](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18197267-don-t-make-me-think-revisited) after that.

After a year of this, one of my best friends called me up one day and asked me if I wanted to spend 3 months with her in a Palestinian refugee camp in Lebanon. DragonBox was in a bit of a lull at the time with little product or community work to do, so I decided to not renew my contract and headed off to the next adventure.

## Formative Travels

[Rashidieh Camp](https://www.unrwa.org/where-we-work/lebanon/rashidieh-camp) is a tiny city of 30â€™000 people living in brick & cement households. It is closing in on being a *century* old, having been established in 1936 (the Palestinians arrived later, in 1963). As such it is an unusual place where time has stood still for generations.

One of the best ways for the campâ€™s (especially younger) inhabitants to get out is by means of the internet, which lets them connect with people and opportunities beyond the confines of their walls. The internet was an important grounding force for me as well during my stay there. The web was a reliable reminder of forward movement in a place that was literally forbidden by law to develop itself.

> ðŸ•Š My experience in places like Rashidieh has deeply affected my ethics and worldview. What separates me from the people living under radically more difficult conditions is pure luck. Iâ€™m drawn to innovations like open source and remotely-distributed working because the barrier to entry is relatively low. Given an education, a computer and an internet connection, thereâ€™s a way up and out. It is one of my lifelong missions to be part of companies that provide opportunity to those who have none.

## Discourse

By the time I returned to Norway (2014) I had already been getting quite actively involved in the [Discourse community](https://meta.discourse.org/). We were using the Discourse forum platform for jMonkeyEngine, and I soon found myself spending more time on Discourse than jME.

Eventually I was contributing on such a regular basis that it just made sense to have me join the company as their [first Community Advocate](https://blog.discourse.org/2015/12/discourse-team-grows-by-50/). This was a monumental moment for me as I had never before been paid to do this *open source thing* that had occupied so much of my time and brain cycles on a purely volunteer basis.

I quickly learned the crucial [difference between an open source project and an open source company](https://meta.discourse.org/t/which-is-better-discourse-or-flarum/71726/7) and how theyâ€™re not mutually exclusive, but rather highly complementary.

Some of my favorite projects at Discourse include the [Encouragement Fund](https://blog.discourse.org/2017/02/the-discourse-encouragement-fund/) and our [Free Hosting program](https://blog.discourse.org/2018/11/free-hosting-for-open-source-v2/), as well as a whole bunch of [open product development](https://meta.discourse.org/u/erlend_sh/summary).

Towards the end of my tenure at Discourse I was running a team of 10 community advocates split between me and my counterpart in New Zealand. I was deeply invested in the company with strong opinions on how it should be run. These opinions eventually diverged so far from those of the founders that our paths were no longer aligned, and so we amicably parted ways in 2019.

> *Update:* In Q3 & Q4 of 2021 I returned for 6 months to direct the [introduction of chat to Discourse](https://meta.discourse.org/t/introducing-discourse-chat-pre-alpha/210734), which became a [flagship feature of Discourse 3.0](https://blog.discourse.org/2023/01/discourse-3-0-is-here/).)

## Rust GameDev & Amethyst

The year thereafter was spent getting deeply involved with the Rust game development ecosystem, culminating in me [joining the board](https://web.archive.org/web/20190712145556/https://community.amethyst.rs/t/welcome-say-hello/99/) of the Amethyst organisation and [helping to establish](https://internals.rust-lang.org/t/a-working-group-for-rust-game-development/8240) the Rust GameDev Working Group.

The Amethyst org has since been [superceded by the Bevy project](https://web.archive.org/web/20220719130541/https://community.amethyst.rs/t/bevy-engine-addressing-the-elephant-in-the-room/1645?u=erlend_sh). Aside from my own projects, most of my time in the Rust gamedev community is spent consulting indie developers on how they can turn their passion projects into a sustainable living.

## Spicy Lobster & Fish Folk

After some 3-6 month stints at [Heroic Labs](https://heroiclabs.com/), [Meilisearch](https://www.meilisearch.com/) and Discourse in 2020-2021, I fully committed to the life of an indie gamedev as the founder of a studio collective called [Spicy Lobster](https://spicylobster.itch.io/).

Coming back full circle to my Wc3 origins, this studio would specialize in making [Everlasting Games](https://spicylobster.itch.io/jumpy/devlog/337996/everlasting-games). We successfully funded our flagship game [Fish Folk on Kickstarter](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/erlendsh/fish-folk) in 2023.

In typical gamedev fashion we've since missed our intended launch date by a nautical mile. 2025 will be Fish Folk's big year; we just gotta fix the internet real quick first.

## Community OS & the fediverse

In 2023 the web I'd grown up in started to come apart at the seams. I began writing about it in a series called [Reclaiming my digital identity](https://blog.erlend.sh/reclaiming-my-digital-identity). This train of thought quickly led to the conceptual and progressively tangible notion of a [Community OS](https://blog.erlend.sh/assembling-community-os), an operating system for digital communications, assembled with modern-day web protocols.

[2023 was a year of much rumination and writing](https://blog.erlend.sh/archive/). As the months passed the urgency of change grew more intense. By early 2024 I teamed up with the lead dev of Fish Folk to reify what felt like our best shot at making all of our other indie ventures possible downstream: [Weird](https://weird.one/).
